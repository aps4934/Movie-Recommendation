Built with Python and machine learning libraries, the system delivers dynamic, real-time recommendations through an interactive interface.

📌 Features
🔍 Content-based filtering using genres, cast, director, and plot.

🤝 Collaborative filtering using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Matrix Factorization.

🧠 Machine learning models for recommendation logic.

💬 Simple and intuitive web interface (Streamlit or Flask).

📊 Clean UI to rate movies and view suggestions instantly.

🛠 Tech Stack
Languages: Python

Libraries/Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Surprise, Streamlit or Flask
